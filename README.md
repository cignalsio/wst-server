# WebSocket Time Protocol (WST) Server

A (very) simple server implementation of the WebSocket Time Protocol (WST) in Rust, based on the work by M. Gutbrod, et al. in [A light-weight time protocol based on common web standards](https://uhr.ptb.de/wst/paper).

Used on and sponsored by [Cignals footprint charts](https://cignals.io/) cryptocurrency charting platform.
